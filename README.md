# TOPSIS-ALGORITHM
Implemented the TOPSIS algorithm in C++ to evaluate optimal transport routes based on five weighted decision criteria.
Normalized the matrix, applied weights, and computed ideal solutions to rank travel routes using closeness coefficients.

How to Run the Project
1.	Clone the repository:
2.	git clone https://github.com/Priyanshu10045/TOPSIS-ALGORITHM
3.	Navigate to the project directory:
4.	Compile and run the C++ file:
5.	g++ topsis.cpp -o topsis
6.	Follow the prompts or modify the matrix in-code to test other route options.
